# DelaunayTriangulation
My take on Unity code written here: https://github.com/ScottyRAnderson/Delaunay-Triangulation/tree/575f8fb98109b37c186432ae4b35fb3999c50ae0
There are direct translations of the code but modified to fit Processing.
Additions: Point movement -- follows a perlin noise field to wander around the screen and wrap around the edges.
